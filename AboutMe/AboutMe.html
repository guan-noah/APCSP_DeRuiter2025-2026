                    He also went to Gleanings for the Hungry this summer (2025).<br>
                    He enjoyed making memories in the game room with friends.

                    Noah ate a lot of great food. He enjoyed it most when he got to
                    spend family time with food -- especially when he thought the food
                    was delicious!
